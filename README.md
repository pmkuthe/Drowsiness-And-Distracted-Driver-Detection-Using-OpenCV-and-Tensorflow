# Drowsiness-And-Distracted-Driver-Detection-Using-OpenCV-and-Tensorflow
The DCUBE system uses a web camera that points directly towards the  driver's face and monitors the driver's head movements in order to detect fatigue. If fatigue is detected, a warning signal is issued to alert the driver. The focus will be placed on designing a system that will accurately monitor the head movements of a driver in real-time. By monitoring the facial and head movements, it is believed that the symptoms of driver fatigue/drowsiness can be detected early enough to avoid a car accident. The DCUBE system uses a web camera that points directly towards the driver's face and monitors the driver's head movements in order to detect fatigue. In such a case when drowsy is detected, a warning signal is issued to alert the driver.
